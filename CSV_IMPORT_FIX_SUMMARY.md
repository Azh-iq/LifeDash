# CSV Import Database Error Fix Summary

## Problem
CSV import shows successful parsing (66 transactions detected) but fails with "unknown error" when trying to save to database.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Transaction Type Mapping Issues**
**Problem**: Some Nordnet transaction types weren't mapped to valid database enum values.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added missing transaction type mappings in `lib/integrations/nordnet/types.ts`
- Fixed `REVERSAL` and `ADJUSTMENT` to map to valid enum values (`WITHDRAWAL` and `FEE`)
- Added fallback logic in `field-mapping.ts` for unknown transaction types

### 2. **Data Validation Issues**
**Problem**: Transaction records could have missing or invalid required fields.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive validation in `transaction-transformer.ts` before database insert
- Validates required fields: `internal_transaction_type`, `booking_date`, `amount`, `currency`
- Ensures `other_fees` is never negative using `Math.max(0, ...)`
- Ensures `exchange_rate` is positive with minimum value 0.0001

### 3. **Enhanced Error Logging**
**Problem**: "Unknown error" messages provided no debugging information.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added detailed error logging throughout the import pipeline
- Enhanced error messages with database error codes, details, and hints
- Added data logging when database operations fail

### 4. **Field Safety Improvements**
**Problem**: Some fields could be null/undefined causing database constraint violations.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added null checks and defaults for all optional fields
- Ensured `external_id` defaults to empty string if missing
- Added fallback for `description` field

## Debugging Tools Created

I've created several debugging scripts to help identify and fix issues:

### 1. **Simple CSV Analysis** (`npm run debug:csv-import`)
- Tests CSV parsing and field mapping without database operations
- Identifies data format and transformation issues

### 2. **Database Operations Test** (`npm run debug:database-operations`)
- Tests database connectivity, authentication, and basic CRUD operations
- Helps identify RLS policy and permission issues

### 3. **End-to-End Test** (`npm run test:csv-import`)
- Tests complete import pipeline with limited number of transactions
- Provides detailed success/failure analysis

### 4. **Issue Analysis** (`npm run fix:csv-import`)
- Comprehensive analysis of CSV data and potential database compatibility issues
- Provides specific recommendations for fixing problems

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Basic CSV Parsing Test
```bash
npm run debug:csv-import
```
This should show successful parsing and transformation without database operations.

### Step 2: Database Operations Test
```bash
npm run debug:database-operations
```
This tests database connectivity and operations. Look for:
- Database connection success
- User authentication or test user access
- Portfolio/account creation capabilities
- Transaction insertion capabilities

### Step 3: Limited Import Test
```bash
npm run test:csv-import
```
This runs the full import pipeline with 5 transactions to verify everything works.

### Step 4: Full Import (if steps 1-3 pass)
Use the actual CSV import functionality in the application.

## Expected Results After Fix

### ‚úÖ What Should Work Now:
- All transaction types should map to valid database enum values
- Required field validation should prevent database constraint violations
- Better error messages should help identify any remaining issues
- Data type consistency should prevent type-related errors

### üîç What to Check If Still Failing:

1. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Verify the CSV import runs with proper user authentication
   - Check that the user has a valid portfolio
   - Ensure RLS policies allow the user to create accounts and transactions

2. **Foreign Key Issues**:
   - Verify accounts can be created and linked to portfolios
   - Check that stock lookup/creation works for ISIN codes
   - Ensure all foreign key references are valid

3. **Permission Issues**:
   - Check Supabase RLS policies for transactions, accounts, portfolios, and stocks tables
   - Verify the service key has proper permissions

## Files Modified

### Enhanced Error Handling:
- `lib/actions/transactions/csv-import.ts` - Added detailed error logging
- `lib/integrations/nordnet/transaction-transformer.ts` - Enhanced error reporting

### Data Validation & Mapping:
- `lib/integrations/nordnet/types.ts` - Fixed transaction type mappings
- `lib/integrations/nordnet/field-mapping.ts` - Added fallback logic for transaction types
- `lib/integrations/nordnet/transaction-transformer.ts` - Added data validation

### Debugging Tools:
- `scripts/debug-csv-import-simple.ts` - CSV parsing test
- `scripts/debug-database-operations.ts` - Database operations test
- `scripts/test-csv-import-end-to-end.ts` - End-to-end test
- `scripts/fix-csv-import-issues.ts` - Issue analysis tool

### Package Scripts:
- `package.json` - Added convenient npm scripts for debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Run the debugging scripts in order** to identify any remaining issues
2. **Check the server logs** (browser dev tools console) when running CSV import for detailed error messages
3. **Verify RLS policies** in Supabase dashboard if authentication-related issues persist
4. **Test with a small subset** before importing the full CSV file

The enhanced error logging should now provide much clearer information about what specifically is failing during the database operations phase.
